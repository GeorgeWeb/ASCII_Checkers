# Modern C++ Checkers game with ASCII art

This project implements a game of checkers with an optimal AI functionality.<br/>
It was given as a final coursework for my Data Structures &amp; Algorithms module at university.<br/>
A freedom of language choice was given so C++ was my language of choice for this one.

## Future development
- implement alpha-beta prunning in the minimax algorithm for AI
- add a decent amount of unit tests ASAP
- add C++Amp for faster and more robust AI algorithm processing
- create a cross-platform build system using CMake
